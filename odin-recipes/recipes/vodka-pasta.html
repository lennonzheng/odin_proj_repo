    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      I found this dish on <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/penne-alla-vodka-106042" target="_blank">Epicurious</a>.
      I found the description on the website is a bit vague, so I have added more details :) 
      It is a simple, flavorful, around 30min dish.
